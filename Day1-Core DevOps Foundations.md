## 📘 Phase 1: Core DevOps Foundations

### 🧩 1. SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
**Phases:**
1. Planning  
2. Design  
3. Development  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment  
6. Maintenance  

🧠 *Traditional SDLC (Waterfall)* was linear and slow.  
**Agile + DevOps** solve this by enabling faster, iterative, and automated delivery.

---

### 🏃‍♂️ 2. Agile Methodology
**Core Principles:**
- Iterative development (2–4 week sprints)  
- Customer feedback at each step  
- Collaboration between teams  
- Adapt and improve continuously  

**Scrum Roles:**
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Product Owner | Defines priorities |
| Scrum Master | Removes blockers |
| Dev Team | Builds and tests increments |

💡 *Agile divides the work; DevOps automates the workflow.*

### ♾️ 3. DevOps Lifecycle
**Phases:**  
> Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Feedback

| Stage | Description | Common Tools |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Plan | Define backlog, features | Jira, Confluence |
| Code | Development & commits | Git, GitHub |
| Build | Compile & package | Maven, Gradle, Docker |
| Test | Unit/integration tests | JUnit, Selenium |
| Release | Versioning & approvals | Jenkins, GitHub Actions |
| Deploy | Infra & app rollout | Terraform, Ansible, Helm |
| Operate | Run & scale | Kubernetes, AWS |
| Monitor | Observe performance | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK |

---

### ⚙️ 4. Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
| Concept | Description | Example Tools |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **CI** | Automate build & test when code changes | Jenkins, GitHub Actions |
| **CD (Delivery)** | Deploy to staging after CI | Argo CD, Spinnaker |
| **CD (Deployment)** | Deploy automatically to production | Jenkins, GitLab CI |

🧠 **CI** = merge + test early  
🧠 **CD** = deliver + deploy automatically

### 💬 5. Interview-Ready Answers

**Q1. What is DevOps?**  
> DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations through automation and collaboration to deliver reliable software faster.

**Q2. Continuous Delivery vs Deployment**  
> Delivery → Ready for deployment  
> Deployment → Automatically goes live

**Q3. Agile + DevOps Relationship**  
> Agile enables small, iterative development. DevOps ensures those increments are deployed quickly and reliably through automation.

### 🧠 Key Takeaway
> “DevOps is not about delivering fast — it’s about delivering the best, continuously.”
